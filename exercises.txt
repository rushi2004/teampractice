two-line rhymes. Start with this program fragment:

start1 = ["fee", "fie", "foe"]
rhymes = [
    ("flop", "get a mop"),
    ("fope", "turn the rope"),
    ("fa", "get your ma"),
    ("fudge", "call the judge"),
    ("fat", "pet the cat"),
    ("fog", "walk the dog"),
    ("fun", "say we're done"),
    ]
start2 = "Someone better"

For each tuple (first, second) in rhymes:

For the first line:

Print each string in start1, capitalized and followed by an exclamation point and a space.
Print first, also capitalized and followed by an exclamation point.

For the second line:
Print start2 and a space.
